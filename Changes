Revision history for Tree-Object

0.03    2016-03-26 (PERLANCAR)

        - This distribution now includes more than one implementation of tree
          objects.

        - [Incompatible change] Rename module Tree::Object to
          Tree::Object::Hash. Parent and children are now stored in '_parent'
          and '_children' keys respectively instead of 'parent' and 'children',
          to denote that they are internal and to reduce chance of clash. To set
          children, an arrayref must now be passed to children() instead of
          list. This is because passing a list to set an arrayref attribute is
          incompatible with accessor generators.

        - The main module Tree::Object now becomes empty and contains just a
          link to all the available implementations.

        - Add Tree::Object::Array.
